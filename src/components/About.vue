        <b-card class="mt-3" header="About Sifiso Myeza">
          <p>
            Sifiso Myeza was born in Kwa-Zulu Natal at Durban, Umlazi in 1992 October 11.
            <br />
            He grew up in a familly that consist of 8 members, 4 boys, 2 girls, mom and dad.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 1999, one of the boys, a second born, passed away.
            <br />
            In 2001, Sifiso's Dada passed away, leaving behind 5 children and the mother.
            <br />
            Unfortunately, he was the breadwinner and when he passed, we were left with nothing
            <br />
            <br />
            At an age of 12,
            Sifso Myeza was already in the hustle of doing anything that would bring
            income to at least buy bread.
            <br />
            <br />
            Years went by and in 2011, Sifiso Myeza got accepted at UCT
            in an Extended Science Program.
            <br />
            That is when and where he got introduced to Computer Science,
            having not owned a computer before nor toached one.
            <br />
            <br />
            That was Sifiso Myeza's carree path initiations in the field of Computer Science.

        <b-card class="mt-3" header="Why Sifiso Myeza likes coding">
          <p>
            The first time Sifiso wrote a program, he experienced something out of this
            world. Giving a computer an instruction and seeing it does exactly what
            it is instructed, was mind blowing.
            <br />
            <br />
            From that point onwards, Sifiso could not live with coding.
            Today, he is motivated by solving real world problems using te programming
            skills he has aquired during his carree path.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, with the emergence of Machine Learning and Artificial Intillegence,
            it has grows Sifiso's interest to want to learn more and do more programming
            that would impact the world at large.
